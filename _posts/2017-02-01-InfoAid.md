My first Public Health Informatics Info Aid I worked with the Virus Special Pathogens Branch (VSPB) on the Seoul Virus Outbreak Virus Outbreak.

At the time ther was about 15 states under nvestigation; 17 people infected in 7 states ,started from a a home-based rodent breeder in Wisconsin first to test positive for Seoul virus.

VSPB asked for support to delop a database that would be able to merge/manage data from different database systems (data
from state as well results coming in from lab) [ninjaduck](http://www.ninjaducks.in/) and [hackmaestro](https://hackmaster.in/blog/) my . Sent in on the middle of the invitigation was no easy task  [AUV-IITK](http://auviitk.com), I learned there was not a starndard way of collecting information from the states, information was not machine readble and most folsk did nor want to change any og thire proceses mid stream.[robotics club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/). and no statdarized idenifier from lab to rattery.
