## Â R.A.T.S. Reporting Architecture and Tracking System  
Seoul Virus Outbreak Info Aid

For my Public Health Informatics Info Aid I worked with the Virus Special Pathogens Branch (VSPB) on the Seoul Virus Outbreak Virus Outbreak.

At the time there was about 15 states under investigation; 17 people infected in 7 states, started from a a home-based rodent breeder in Wisconsin first to test positive for Seoul virus.

## Context
![Context](/img/posts/infoAid-context.png)
Lots of stakeholders

## Problem
VSPB asked for support to develop a database that would be able to merge/manage data from different database systems (state data as well results coming in from lab). Easy....

Not so easy.

* Most information was not machine readable (pdfs and faxed documents)

* Method of collecting data from the states not standardized 

* Data elements not standardized

* Each epidemiologist had their own way of collecting and organizing information they received from the states

* Info Aid was requested in the middle of investigation; limited the opportunity to change current process

## Solution

**Database managed and automated by Excel Power Query**
